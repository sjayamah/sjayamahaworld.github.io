<div id="samaaya">How are you doing? You’re giving me these scary blank stares.
</div>

Good, good! I woke up at 5:30, ironed 15 shirts, laundry, cleaned everything and now...

<div id="samaaya">And now we’re sipping coffee together! My friend, the girl who lives upstairs, I mentioned how you get up at 3AM to go to work. And she just looked at me and said wow, it really sounds like capitalism like got the best of him. And I was like no no, he just fucking loves his job.</div>

Oh my god. And it’s the Armed Forces too.

<div id="samaaya">I know. Well then I said that and she looked at me like I was insane.</div>

Wow. That’s really funny. She will be a big time capitalist one day.

<div id="samaaya">I know. Well, she already drives a BMW and she’s younger than me.</div>

So there’s perfect irony.

<div id="samaaya">It’s good.</div>

It’s priceless. But listen, of course I support you in this project, this topic, what we’re about to get into but I have to tell you you’re going to see the worst of, quote unquote, open minded liberals when you do this, because the criticism will not be objective, it will all be ideological, ill informed, visceral and ironic, because they will not realize the irony of their statements and the privileged position from which they are making those judgmental statements. 

<div id="samaaya">Yeah I know. And you know what kills me? I’m not trying to solve and I can’t solve these problems, but I’m working solely to get people to think about these things and talk about it and it’s going to make them deeply uncomfortable, because it is uncomfortable. It is so uncomfortable for me to say I’m an American patriot, because an American patriot “should” be like a bigoted white person with a gun. That’s what a patriot is to the people around me. And I get that. That’s totally the all prevailing image. But challenge that. Why aren’t we? Why have you just accepted that? You’ve given up and you’re like, okay, that’s what America is. I hate my America, not even my America. Just America. But it’s not that America because you’re here. Talk about it! Do something! To reclaim symbols and be perpetually critical at the same time... that to me is the ultimate goal. What could be more intimidating?</div>

That’s the thing, we’ve failed in letting people claim that image. How come Trump, who wrote multiple waivers to avoid going to Vietnam, became the American patriot? Because the others let them, because they have no sense of patriotism, or they’ve never worked to claim it. They haven’t defined it. So they’ve let crazies define what patriotism means.

<div id="samaaya">Yeah, we were talking about this in the car the other day, about how people our age have nothing good to say about the US. And they’re like, we just need to like, reform all these things. But Greg said, that’s almost the greatest sense of the American Dream is to be revolutionary, to see the system that’s been given to you and want to change it. That’s the principles that the country was built on. You know what I mean? </div>

Yeah, exactly, I mean, I am probably the first Sri Lankan to be in airborne infantry in America, and do what I did. And then to be pretty much the first Sri Lankan to be teaching in the Air Force Academy. Like all those things. I don’t think in terms of the first or I made it, it’s because the system allows for it.

<div id="samaaya">Yeah, again, so many things are just so interesting about your position, because you weren’t, and you aren’t out to be like the symbol or like the role model for other Asians to join the armed forces. You’re just doing it. Because you love service. You love America. But alright. Getting into this. I am curious. First and foremost, I feel like I’ve only heard bits and pieces of why you came to the US. Or like, did you plan on going back to Sri Lanka? I don’t ever hear you talk about Sri Lanka. </div>

You know, because in Sri Lanka, I just felt like an alien. Most things Sri Lankans do today they take for granted and I did 20 years ago, I mean, just simple things like human beings do. I don’t know. Just broadly speaking, I just didn’t fit with the mode or the time or the culture. I just didn’t care for the expectations or the traditional, you know, the attitude. Yeah, all those things I just couldn’t stand. And going to the UK, I just knew I’d be surrounded by lots of family, lots of South Asians and it just didn’t speak to me. But I had never been to the US. However, I spent time in US libraries. You know, in the old days, the United States Embassy had this thing called the United States Information Agency. All over the world. And they had libraries. So that created the safe space in the sense, like you can go and you know, read and have oatmeal cookies. Like what’s an oatmeal cookie? I just read, hung out. I’ll joke with my cadets that in some ways, I’m a product of American soft power. Suddenly I wanted to come here. So when I came here, I wasn’t thinking whether I was going to go back or stay but you know, part of me was like I’ll probably end up being back in Sri Lanka.

<div id="samaaya">But all in all you just knew you had to go.</div>

I knew I had to get the hell out of there. Because also conceptually, everything was so limiting and there were narrow minded people. And I was one of the first products 
of globalization so to speak, I’d been abroad, 
I read all this stuff. I read this stuff and I looked around and thought I’m sorry but I’m surrounded by a bunch of ignorant idiots. So I had to get out. But even then I wasn’t planning on staying in the US. Your mom is 
the one who asked me out on a date first. 
So, you know, we fell in love. 

<div id="samaaya">Well, you didn’t go back for 20 years... I went back with you in 2015 right? And how was that?</div>

Yeah, I didn’t go back for 18 years. I’m like, Yeah, whatever. Because there was nothing there, I didn’t miss it. So that’s a good explanation about the disconnect. 

<div id="samaaya">Yeah and that’s where I feel I’m sitting too and I’ve talked to you about that. I’ve so briefly considered making work about being South Asian, but if I think about being South Asian, I’ll cook Sri Lankan food. And that’s that on that. I’ve got nothing else to say about it. I look like this. Sometimes I just think, why would I create like this contrived sense of pride to this place that I’ve been to twice? I also realized I’ve never met another Sri Lankan person just on my own. It’s either been like a family friend or relative. Not another soul. That’s also a very bizarre position to be in that sets me even further apart from that community.</div>

And also, if I wanted you to be Sri Lankan, then wouldn’t I have stayed there?

<div id="samaaya">Yeah true. Although admittedly I wish I was a little more familiar with things because like, it’s fun, plain and simple. It’s really wonderful, it is a sense of pride.  It’s honestly just cool. </div>

Sri Lanka is wonderful to you the way a Sri Lankan person looking at America sees America as wonderful. 

<div id="samaaya">Yeah.</div>

When I joined the military, some people were saying before I joined, you’re gonna be surrounded by lots of rednecks and uneducated people. And you know, you’re going to be the only one of the few brown people in there like, are you sure? I mean, these are white people telling me this, I mean they were trying to be nice. But once when I got to their actual unit, where I ended up working, I realized that’s not what mattered. What mattered was, can you fucking perform? Yeah. And so for me, I realized actually this is the most well integrated place I’ve ever been to. And I’m like, sure, they’re a bunch of loud mouthed, foul mouthed. Crazy goons. Totally. But with a sense of purpose, and super competitive, relentless, driven. And only again, the question was, can you perform? And are you going to be part of the team? And suddenly, I was like oh. I’m home. We call ourselves like, quote, unquote, mass of the conservative so to speak. But why does it have to be conservative? Why is it conservative that we believe in service, we believe in commitment, we believe it’s important to be part of a broader mission that generates collective good, therefore, giving up part of us is acceptable. In fact, it’s part of the duty and obligation is the right way. That’s what built this place! But no, it’s because this idea of the global citizen, but that’s bullshit. The Global Citizen concept exists because we bear the cost of it. 

<div id="samaaya">Yeah. That’s when this all gets really interesting...</div>
</p>

</main>
<center>
<img src="chinook copy.jpg" width=600px; padding-bottom: 50px;>
</center>

<main>
    <p>

Yeah, I mean, because then that meant our ascribed differences then didn’t matter, aren’t supposed to hold us back. That’s not always possible. I mean, you know, it’s a function of changes in policy and people adjust. 

<div id="samaaya">I feel like, obviously, there’s so many, sooo many misconceptions and misunderstandings, I’m just thinking about the community I’m in, what they perceive the military as or the people in the military as. And the thought of performing or having a sense of duty, these larger principles to live and work by... that would never occur to anyone, even though it’s so obvious that that’s what a soldier is doing. It’s a duty, it’s responsibility.</div>

Yeah, I mean, it’s because it’s that sentiment swapped by all this other nonsense, right? 

<div id="samaaya">Well, the other nonsense gets really interesting, really dicey. I feel like what we were talking about the other night, how you said I’m gonna see the worst side of the liberal elite. But I want to bring it out, I just want to hear it. Maybe this is harsh but I want to hear because their claims are coming from such an extreme position of privilege that it’s comical.</div>

Well, I mean, look. This sense of security and prosperity that people enjoy, it doesn’t come for free. These people who claim in system diversity, they are the most intolerable, insufferable. They’re running an insufferable cabaret. I mean, all these things that the people benefit from...it’s because of the things that we’ve worked hard to maintain. And especially the people in the elite schools, their parents are benefiting from what those quote on quote, rednecks and negros are doing, to keep them safe. I mean, it is unfucking-believable. That’s why I am working in the only academic institution that I can work in. Because any other place would the want me to be on the race bandwagon, or the victim bandwagon, or the Wounded Warrior bandwagon. People don’t take it for granted. And the people who least appreciate that, incidentally, are the rich Americans. Because what the military does is an explicit version of cost. But there are other costs, too. And actually, when I travel, so many people point out that they believe in American power. Because sure, the United States is powerful. And like most people, most countries, we’ve got our share of devils. But at the end of the day, we’ve been magnanimous in many ways, right? But this is not a humanistic business. This is about war fighting. This is about foreign policy. What’s in it for us? Why should we give a fuck? Look, when you join the military and work for the military, you give up a certain amount of your human rights. Because the sense of service means service before self. And that includes you don’t get to choose which commander you’re going to fight under. Or which war you will be fighting. And because of this, some of my friends have never voted in their lives. 

<div id="samaaya">I’ve heard this before but it always blows my mind. But it makes a lot of sense. To have such a vast sense of service and responsibility, to be thinking on such a grand scale. Not voting? That’s something that could face so much criticism. People are so righteous about voting. You’re a horrible person, you’re the worst citizen if you do not vote. But when you talk about it on that scale, and that consideration, this is not this is not a personal choice. No.</div>

Exactly. You don’t get to choose what precedent or what war. The only fact is that you will perform. Because the commander in chief will be elected by the people. And that’s all that matters. It is service on behalf of the nation, whatever the fucking president as the elected representative of the people like. I mean, trying to uphold ourselves to these ideals, that is so fucking important. So my friends who planned part of the stuff for the 2003 invasion in Iraq were thinking, man, this is such a terrible idea, this is not gonna end well. But it’s a duty and you know, lawmakers approved it. I mean, that’s the job. Ultimately, citizens and lawmakers authorized it. But that is really what service is. That’s why me, my friends can’t complain, right? 
I mean, every single kid in a military family would have lived in 11 different schools in an 18 year period at a minimum. That’s why it’s not just a job for these people. It’s also a lifestyle. It wasn’t just me. Your Mama bore the cost of it, you bore the cost of it.

<div id="samaaya">Yeah... also, a slightly cheesy question but also genuine, the American Dream! What’s the American dream to you? I’m so interested in reclaiming these concepts or symbols surrounding it because damn, it’s the biggest disappointment ever that an American patriot is a racist white guy. Redneck, hillbilly, you know what I mean? So yeah, of course, no one wants to say that they love the country, when that’s the image that’s assigned. No one wants to identify with that. And that sucks.</div>

But why did they capture it? Why is that the image? It’s because liberals think nationalism is a bad thing. I remember a professor telling me that things like nationalism and sovereignty, those are just all concepts that will have no place in the future. That’s what the generations of people that came of age, it’s like, the rally around the flag, you know, the sense of community and nationalism, that’s all bad, because we’re all going to be global citizens. Then the problem becomes that if you’re a global citizen, that anytime a global citizen comes and takes the place, it replaces an American, and it’s not reciprocal. So ultimately, Americans bear the burden. So the people who are out there voting for elected members to destroy global institutions that their great grandparents risked their lives to build, it’s the indictment of the liberal internationalists. So now, the simple fact that if you are to wear a T shirt with the American flag on your campus, and people don’t like it, do they know why they don’t like it? I mean, isn’t that interesting?

<div id="samaaya">Yeah. And that’s where I feel like my position, to be a non white woman is the ultimate position in a sense to speak to these topics. Because okay, a white guy could express these same sentiments but because he’s white and male, no one wants to hear it and rightfully so, it would just sound like you’re insecure to be in a position of privilege, with no checks against you. It’s weird, a kind of horrible thing to say, but people will listen to me, more likely, on something like this, because of my background, my upbringing, and simply because I look like this and like the system is supposedly against me. </div>

<center>
<img src="horse copy.jpg" width=600px;>
</center>

That’s the thing, the system isn’t against you. That’s how it’s perceived at least. It’s not about individuals and it’s not about race or ethnic categories. It’s socioeconomic. 
A poor Asian, poor black person, poor white person, have a harder time getting into Brown, or it’s impossible rather than a rich black guy, rich asian guy and rich white guy. It’s socio economic and it’s social capital. The only reason you are at RISD is because you 
had good social capital.

<div id="samaaya">Exactly. I went to high school where I was surrounded by people who were motivated to go to Harvard. Therefore, I was like oh, I guess I should be on that page too. That exposure to very specific things like that are really just luxuries. That exposure has fueled me and has taken me to where I am now and still is continuing to push me in directions that I didn’t expect, even stupid stuff, like new hobbies even. </div>

So I mean, for me the American dream. Okay, let’s say it’s compared to Sri Lanka out here. Well, for starters, I can be what the fuck 
I am. And that’s really important. 

<div id="samaaya">That’s how I see it too. And that’s when you tell me that I am the American Dream. Because of all these crazy specific traits inhabiting one body, one experience.</div>

Yeah, right? I say I want to join the most elite airborne infantry unit in the world. 
And they say, well, we can sign you up. You’re just gonna have to prove your worth. Prove your worth and earn your keep. Okay. And then I become a paratrooper in the elite unit and then I go to war with a bunch of people from all over the nation. I mean, it’s called the all American Division. For all over the pretty much the world we had Iranians, Ecuadorian, Venezuelans, Sri Lankans, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and people from all over the US, right. The whole works. That’s America, right? I did that then I applied to graduate school. I mean, sure, I had to work hard. It didn’t come normally. So I go to Northwestern, a top 10 University. So I was probably the first Sri Lankan to be both airborne infantry man and connaissance guy, and now I’m the first Sri Lankan teacher at the Air Force Academy, but it’s irrelevant. There, I’m not a fucking Sri Lankan, there are all these people who come from other backgrounds too. The fact is, I can perform, I do a good job, therefore, I feel value. Now, that’s a very individual version of the American dream. But for me, also, I do believe in the American like values in the constitution about classic liberal ideas of individual freedom, but also that protecting that individual freedom requires a sense of service and the sense of community, the nation, and we need a state and a government to guarantee that. So for me there’s that sense of community, we are social beings, we love a sense of belonging. At least I do. And I mean, it’s my personal thing. It’s not about America but for me to live without a sense of purpose and a sense of commitment... that is not fulfilling.

<div id="samaaya">Yeah, you’ve mentioned that before.</div>

I mean, to be part of a broader mission. It’s important. And that’s why religious people tend to be in the military. It’s because there’s something about this sense of purpose and higher purpose that animates them. It’s because religious people, irrespective of the religion, are animated by a sense of service and sense of commitment. And for me, that sense of commitment and sense of service being proud of a greater purpose. It gives me a lot of meaning, it may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things. I really don’t give a fuck about that. But I know, when I come home, I’ve done my little part. And that’s really fucking important. And I do love the fact that everyone stops their cars and gets out of their cars. To stand for the flag. And without overtime, I can put five extra hours in a day. 

<div id="samaaya">Yes! That moment when we were on the base walking around. My immediate thought, the comparison made was the athan, the call to prayer. That’s how it felt to me. The beautiful moment, magical, just unbelievable. And I know. It’s not work, I never really think of you working, you’re just having a great time.</div>

Yeah, incidentally, the two places that have felt that my race and where I am from, makes me not belong, was in the NGO community. To 
go into Africa you just got to be white and come from a rich country. The other place or the university. And the only time someone called the police on me, because I look like the fucker that I guess you shouldn’t sit next to in the airplane. I was just walking around at night and it happened. And it’s a university professor who called the police. 

<div id="samaaya">Yeah, you always tell me that. Never forgetting that one.</div>

Now, if someone else were to do that, that’s racism, especially if the police would have done it. But because he’s a professor—

<div id="samaaya">Haha, he’s a liberal professor so he’s right.</div>

Not that they’re always wrong. There are many things about them that you know, it’s just the fucking balance. You need the middle. Yeah. The crazies on the left and the crazies on the right. They are mirror images of each other.

<div id="samaaya">The damn horse shoe, man. They’re so different that they’re similar.</div>

I’ll end it with this. One of my good friends, he was from Ecuador. He was a permanent resident, serving in the army. He was killed in Iraq. He had put in the position to be a US citizen. He died not a US citizen. And before he was buried in Texas, the Army flew his father from Ecuador, and then there were people from the immigration services that came to the funeral and made my buddy a US citizen, draped the flag over him and then buried them. Also, because if they didn’t do that, all the petitions he’s put in place on behalf of his wife and children would die with him. Right? People don’t know that shit, you know? It’s because these people like getting up in this rage and victim narrative. It’s this sense of service and sense of like, call for higher purpose, right? It’s been replaced with the form of strategic narcissism. Narcissism has replaced patriotism and sense of service. It’s just so fucking bizarre. I mean I say this all the time when people ask why did you join the army, there could have been many reasons but you know, I’m quoting scripture but it’s because it captures the moment, it’s a moment recurring throughout history and it will keep recurring every time. It goes: I heard the voice of the Lord say, whom Shall I send who will go for us? And you say here am I, send me. I didn’t know how it was gonna end but I knew that I would regret not saying send me if I didn’t raise my hand. Are there costs to it? Sure. Did you bear a big chunk of that burden? Sure. Could it have gone another way? A terrible way? Yes. I’ll tell you, another one of my buddies, it was the first time I’ve actually seen brain matter. His brain’s fucking split open, there was no question he was gonna die. You could always hope he would live but the brain’s the last thing to realize the brains split open. In addition to all the other injuries. And when they called the medic in, I swear to you on your soul. His line was “I don’t need a fucking medic. Made sure my boys are okay. Go go take care of my boys.” Those were his dying words, girl! So when I’m sucking at life between mile 19 and 26 in a marathon, I think of all my brothers. They are my inspiration. So I tell my cadets, when they say thank you, Dr. Jay, I say don’t fucking thank me. Do well, live well. Do great. Be fucking great. Get after it.
Damn. Thank you for this. 

<div id="samaaya">Yeah, let’s continue the conversation.</div>

Yeah, no doubt. This is not ending anytime soon. I will keep you posted.

<div id="samaaya">Alright.</div>

Godspeed. Love you.

<div id="samaaya">Love you too.</div>
